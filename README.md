LOOK & FEEL
🎨Dine ‘n’ Doc Style Pillars
1. Raw & Real
Lean into the unpolished, candid feel of disposable film—grainy textures, soft focus, and natural imperfections that bring out the authentic, human side of the event.

2. Handcrafted Warmth
Incorporate hand-drawn elements, rough sketches, and doodles that give off a DIY, intimate vibe. It’s about creating a visual experience that feels like it was made by real people, not machines.

3. Nostalgic Playfulness
Capture the fun, carefree spirit of early 2000s birthday invites with bold, playful fonts, vibrant colors, and quirky details. It should feel like something you’d pass out to friends, full of excitement and spontaneity.

4. Tactile Design
Use textures that mimic physical materials like butcher paper, ripped edges, or stickers—designs that invite interaction and feel personal, like something you’d want to touch or doodle on.

5. Imperfect Harmony
Embrace asymmetry, off-kilter layouts, and mismatched elements. It’s about showing that imperfection can be beautiful and that a little chaos makes things feel more real and alive.

1. Fun with Purpose
At Dine 'n' Doc, we believe in balancing fun and intention. The setting is casual, the vibe is light, but the conversations are deep. We’re here to enjoy good food and company, all while diving into stories that make us think and inspire action.
2. Curated Connection
Every gathering is crafted to feel intimate and meaningful. We bring together small groups in cozy spaces, creating a sense of community where everyone has a voice and can engage fully with the film and each other.

About
Dine 'n' Doc is all about good vibes, good food, and good conversation. We meet in living rooms across the Bay Area, share pizza, and watch docs that make you think—without taking ourselves too seriously. It’s a night to gather intentionally, reflect on the stories we see, and spark meaningful conversations. With special guests, including the filmmakers, it’s all about celebrating community and ideas that matter.
History
Dine 'n' Doc started back in 2010 when Chloe was an RA in college, hosting nights where friends came together to eat, watch docs, and take action—whether that meant donating, writing to our representatives, or gathering supplies. What began in her dorm room has since made its way to living rooms across San Francisco, but the spirit remains the same: food, film, and a little change-making.
